### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris, from Germany, and currently studying.
In my free time, i like to code - here are some of my projects:

Fabric mods:
- [visitors](https://github.com/onebeastchris/visitors): A fabric mod allowing non-whitelisted players to check out the server in spectator mode.
- [Hurricane-Fabric](https://github.com/onebeastchris/Hurricane-Fabric): A fabric port of [GeyserMC's Hurricane](https://github.com/geysermc/hurricane) plugin.
- [CustomPlayerHeads](https://github.com/onebeastchris/customplayerheads): A fabric mod to get player heads for both Java and Bedrock players.

Geyser Extensions:
- [MagicMenu](https://github.com/onebeastchris/MagicMenu): A Geyser Extension to run commands with Bedrock edition forms. Fully customizable, with support for placeholders.
- [PickPack](https://github.com/onebeastchris/PickPack): A Geyser Extension to allow players to choose their own resource packs.

Plugins:
- [GeyserPackSync](https://GitHub.com/onebeastchris/GeyserPackSync): A Bungeecord/Velocity plugin to allow Bedrock players via Geyser to have different resource packs per network server.

Support for mods/extensions is offered on my discord server: https://discord.gg/WdmrRHRJhS
